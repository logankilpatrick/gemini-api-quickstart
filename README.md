# Gemini API Quickstart - Python

This repository contains a simple Python Flask App running with the Google AI Gemini API, designed to get you started building with Gemini's multi-modal capabilities. The app comes with a basic UI and a Flask backend.

## Basic request

To send your first API request with the [Gemini API Python SDK](https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-python), make sure you have the right dependencies installed (see installation steps below) and then run the following code:

```python
import os
import google.generativeai as genai

GOOGLE_API_KEY = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")

genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')

chat = model.start_chat(history=[])
response = chat.send_message("In one sentence, explain how AI works to a child.")
# Note that the chat object is temporarily stateful, as you send messages and get responses, you can 
# see the history changing by doing `chat.history`.

print(response.text)
```

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, install it [from Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository.

3. Create a new virtual environment:

   - macOS:

     ```bash
     $ python -m venv venv
     $ . venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - Windows:
     ```cmd
     > python -m venv venv
     > .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. Install the requirements:

   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Make a copy of the example environment variables file:

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

6. Add your [API key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) to the newly created `.env` file.

7. Run the app:

```bash
$ flask run
```

You should now be able to access the app from your browser at the following URL: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)!
